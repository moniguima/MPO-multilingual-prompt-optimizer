  structural:
    - "Add culturally-appropriate greetings/closings"

  content:
    - "Reframe task-focus vs. relationship-focus"
    - "Adjust explicitness (low-context vs. high-context)"
    - "Modify tone (warmth vs. precision)"

  validation:
    - "Native speaker review (future phase)"
    - "Back-translation check (future phase)"
